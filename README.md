# Additional Challenge
A mod that allows you to use effects to make your game more challenging. Most of the effects from hollow twitch and more are available in the modmenu to be used.

## How it works
There are 46 [available effects](#available-effects) that can each be enabled separately from the modmenu. Also, cooldown effects and boss attacks have an additional setting called "coolDown" that dictates after how much time the effect will run again.
There is also a [chaos mode](#chaos-mode) that randomly selects from enabled list and does the effects

## Chaos Mode
In choas mode, the mod randomly selects effects to happen periodically. This helps replicate the feel of hollow twitch.
There are 4 toggles for this mode.
1. Enable/Disable Toggle:
2. Effects Cooldown: The cooldown before the next set of effects are delivered
3. Number of effects: The number of effects that happen on every cycle
4. Effects trigger delay: Only works when Number of effects is more than 1. It allows you to create a delay between triggering effects, allowing you to make it so multiple effects dont happen at once and effects are happening all the time.
> Note: In this mode only enabled effects are selected
